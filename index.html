      <p>Hello! My name is Saige, and I’m a third-year student majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction. The cross-section between computers and the human mind is a beautiful thing, and I hope to delve deeper into how these two interact. 
        My goal is to have a career in UI/UX and utilize all the fancy psychology and computer science principles I have learned. </p>
    </p><p>Personal Background: In the wondrous year of 2005, I was born in Greensville, NC, but I’ve lived in a lot of different parts of North Carolina. My current hometown is Lewisville, NC, but no one knows where that is, so I say Winston-Salem. 
        My dad is a huge computer nerd and loves to build computers in his free time, and my brothers and I played lots of video games as kids, so I got into the technology nerd field quite young. My high school computer science teacher was the 
        final push for me to decide to major in Computer Science, so now I’m here! I’m a woman of many hobbies, but I enjoy writing poetry, playing FPS and farming simulator games, baking, reading, and making personalized playlists.
      <p>Professional Background: I’ve had about 7-8 jobs since I was 16, but I’ve enjoyed working in a University setting the most. Since my first year here, I’ve been involved in UNC Charlotte’s Housing and Residence Life department, and 
        have held positions such as Director of External Affairs for RSA, Desk Assistant, Summer Resident Advisor, and now a Full Year Resident Advisor. This previous summer, I worked with the 
        Office of Undergraduate Research on a Computer Science research project called BRIDGES, where I worked with Professor KRS to build computer science assignments for introductory high school and college computer science courses.
      <p>Academic Background: I’m a third-year student majoring in Computer Science, hoping to graduate in December 2026. My concentration is in Human-Computer Interaction, and my minor is in Cognitive Science. </p>
      <p>Primary Computer: Custom-built, Windows 10, desktop, dorm</p>
      <p>Courses I’m Taking, & Why:
        <ul>
        <li>ITCS 3688 - Computers and Their Impact on Society: Although required, I’m interested in the ethics of new and upcoming technology and how our society will go about integrating all of it into our day-to-day lives.</li>
        <li>ITSCS 3610 - Computing Leaders Seminar: This course offers a service-based leadership opportunity, and it’s a great way to give back to your community while also learning new things yourself.</li>
        <li>STAT 1220 - Elements of Stat I: I may have tamed the beast of Calculus 2, but switching to a B.A. means you have to also start over your math.</li>
        <li>ITIS 3135 - Front-End Web Application Development: Required - but I need to learn how to make websites, etc., for my UI/UX portfolio!</li>
        <li>ITIS 3130 - Introduction to Human-Centered Computing: Although required, this class talks about pretty much everything I’m interested in.</li> 
    </ul></p>
    <p>Funny story: I decided to go down the UI/UX path when I decided I hated doing all the math and harder coding.</p>
    <p>Something I'd like to share: never stop following your dreams!</p>
