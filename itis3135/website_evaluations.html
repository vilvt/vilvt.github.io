      <h3><a href="https://wonjyou.studio/" target="_blank">Won J You Studios</a></h3>
      <p>Won J You Studios is a design coaching & mentorship site with a clean and modern aesthetic, showcasing strong visuals, clear navigation, and well organized content.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> This site uses bold headings, vivid images, and clear distinction between call-to-action items and body text, which helps focus user attention. The website is bold and different from other websites visually.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Font and heading styles are consistent, button/link styles are reused, layout patterns repeat in different sections, providing visual harmony.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Images and text boxes are aligned to a grid, margins and spacing are consistent, navigation and content are placed in predictable positions.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements (like contact, services, navigation) are grouped, whitespace separates different content areas, making the page easier to scan and digest.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngren.net</a></h3>
      <p>Arngren.net is extremely cluttered, with many images, lots of links, visually chaotic layout, making it hard to find any hierarchy or know where to look first.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Lacks clear contrast between important and less important elements; many items have similar visual weight; clickable items are not clearly distinguished.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Many differing fonts, styles, image types; little consistency in how links/buttons/features are styled.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Very irregular layout; elements appear randomly placed without alignment; text and images are not aligned on visible grid.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related content is not grouped; there is minimal whitespace; the site feels overwhelming because so much is crammed together.</li>
      </ul>
