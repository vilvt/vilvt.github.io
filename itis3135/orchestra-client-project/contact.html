      <h2>Participation Information</h2>
      <p>Participation in the UNC Charlotte Orchestra is open to all students at UNC Charlotte.</p>
      <p>The UNC Charlotte Orchestra (MUPF 1110) represents the highest-level orchestral performance group at UNC Charlotte. The Orchestra presents music from across the symphonic repertoire, emphasizing the art and science of group musical interaction. An audition is required for enrollment.</p>
      <p>As part of the Orchestra Mosaic project, the ensemble combines annually with student and faculty musicians from other educational institutions to create collaborative performances at various metropolitan concert venues. This strategy allows repertoire to be performed more than once, increasing the learning potential for each student.</p>
      <p><strong>NEW FOR FALL 2025:</strong> Due to the limited time frame before the first midterm concert (Tuesday, September 30), a chamber orchestra program requiring fewer string players is planned. Selected students will perform in the September concert, while all string players will participate in the second orchestra program in late November.</p>

      <h2>Fall 2025 - Spring 2026 Auditions</h2>
      <p>All new and returning string players must audition with Dr. Alan Yamamoto during the first week of classes. All wind and brass students will audition with Dr. Hunter Kopczinski and Dr. Brian Taylor and be assigned to the orchestra class accordingly.</p>
      <p>All string players should sign up for a 10-minute individual appointment with Dr. Yamamoto: <a href="#">Fall 2025 Orchestra String Audition Sign-up Sheet</a>.</p>
      <p>Students with class conflicts should contact Dr. Yamamoto directly (preferably before the first week of classes) at ayamamot@charlotte.edu</a> to set up an individual appointment.</p>
      <p>Wind and brass students who participate in the first-week auditions do not need a separate orchestra audition. New incoming wind and brass students may contact Dr. Hunter Kopczinski at hkopczin@charlotte.edu</a> to schedule an audition.</p>
      <p><strong>Audition Preparation:</strong> Prepare a 1–2 minute excerpt from a standard classical concerto, solo sonata, popular song, or church hymn. Additionally, all students must play at least two major scales in two octaves, up and down, and a sight-reading excerpt will be included.</p>
